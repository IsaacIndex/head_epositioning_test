# Therapy Use
Poor posture has been suggested as one of the main factors contributing to the high prevalence of neck pain in video display unit (VDU) users.
Postural awareness of the neck, as indicated by the repositioning accuracy, may therefore be an appropriate measure and potentially useful assessment tool. 
Neck proprioception detect is an app which measures the postural integrity ( joint sense) of the neck by mobile phoneâ€™s 3-D accelerometers attached to the head.
Ten repetitions of the posture were recorded, and the angular deviations from the original head position were measured and calculated.

# Usage
Users first insert the number of rounds and sets they want to practice. Then put the phone on the head and start doing the exercise. By pressing 'Add', the app will record the position of the head. Alternatively, users can also use any bluetooth devices to trigger the 'Add' button.
